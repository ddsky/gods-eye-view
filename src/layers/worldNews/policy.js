 * News API key; the proxy answers 503 {error:'no_key'} without one and the
 * layer reports `keyRequired` instead of failing).

 * Only the contract fields reach the browser: id, title, url, domain,
 * timestamps, the provider's sentiment score, category, language, source
 * country and ONE place named in the headline. No article text, summaries,
 * images, authors or person/organization entities — ever. Pins mark where
 * a headline is about, not where it was published.
